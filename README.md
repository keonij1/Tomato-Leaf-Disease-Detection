# Tomato-Leaf-Disease-Detection


This repository contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model developed for the detection of diseases in tomatoes. A total of 11,000 tomato images were used, divided into 10 different classes representing common diseases found in tomatoes.

The main objective of this project is to provide an automated and accurate solution for detecting diseases in tomato crops, enabling farmers to quickly identify plant health issues and take appropriate measures to control diseases and minimize losses.

A set of 1,000 images was allocated for model validation, and various CNN architectures were evaluated to achieve the best results. After rigorous training and validation, the model achieved validation accuracy above 84% for all evaluated disease classes.

In this repository, you will find the complete source code of the CNN model, including data preprocessing, network construction, training, and evaluation.
